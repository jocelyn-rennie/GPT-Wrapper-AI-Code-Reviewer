# GPT-Wrapper-AI-Code-Reviewer

Placed 2nd in a 10-day Valyfy AI Assistant competition.

## Description
Over 10 days, I created a wireframe for my website using Vercel (v0) and then actually created the website and its functionalities by prompting the AI in the Cursor application. I had not used these tools before and I much enjoyed learning how to use them. It was so interesting to see how powerful AI could be, I had created something I had never done before by just using the help of AI prompts.

## Future Development
I created a fully working app, but I wanted to improve it with more AI promts. I tried to improve the code editor with highlighting and line numbers but then
something went wrong and continuous input was not working. I continually promted the AI and it could not fix this? Then I ran out of free promts available on Cursor. If I had more time, I wouldv'e tackled this problem to get the code reviewer to function how I intended.
